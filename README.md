# Responsive Discord

Inspired by https://github.com/samuelthomas2774/bd-hide-sidebars

A BetterDiscord theme that collapses the Discord sidebars and tweaks large elements when your window is too small. Hover over the collapsed area to access the sidebars.

Install [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/), then import the following file as a theme. (You can download the file by right-clicking and selecting `Save as...`)
